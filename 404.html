<h1>404</h1>
<i>
<pre id=1>
Not a pretty sight
When the web dies screaming loud
The site is not found.
</pre>
<pre id=2>
Morning and sorrow
404 not with us now
Lost to paradise.
</pre>
<pre id=3>
The dream is shattered
The web site cannot be found
Inside the spring rain.
</pre>
<pre id=4>
Click exciting link
Gossamer threads hold you back
404 not found.
</pre>
<pre id=5>
Aborted effort:
The site, passed this veil of tears.
You ask way too much.
</pre>
<pre id=6>
Site slips through fingers
Pulse pounding hard and frantic
Vanishing like mist.
</pre>
<pre id=7>
The web site you seek
Lies beyond our perception
But others await.
</pre>
<pre id=8>
Emptyness of soul
Forever aching blackness:
"Blah.com not found."
</pre>
<pre id=9>
Rather than a beep
Or a rude error message,
These words: 'Site not found.'
</pre>
<pre id=10>
Something you entered
Transcended parameters.
The site is unknown.
</pre>
<pre id=11>
Won't you please observe
A brief moment of silence
For the dead server?
</pre>
<pre id=12>
Cables have been cut
Southwest of Northeast somewhere
We are not amused.
</pre>
<pre id=13>
Site is silent, yes
No voices can be heard now
The cows roll their eyes.
</pre>
<pre id=14>
To have no errors
Would be life without meaning
No struggle, no joy
</pre>
<pre id=15>
Errors have occurred.
We won't tell you where or why.
Lazy programmers.
</pre>
<pre id=16>
Server's poor response
Not quick enough for browser.
Timed out, plum blossom.
</pre>
<pre id=17>
Login incorrect.
Only perfect spellers may
Enter the system.
</pre>
<pre id=18>
The code was willing
It considered your request,
But the chips were weak.
</pre>
<script>
document.getElementById(Math.floor((Math.random() * 18) + 1)).style.display = "inline";
</script>
