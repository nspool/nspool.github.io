      <description>Where to start writing apps for Plan 9 from Bell Labs? Most of the documentation around focuses on the shell and the file system. The tutorial explains how to write a simple bouncing ball app for the Plan 9 UI.
First, install either the official Plan 9 distribution or the community fork 9front. If you are only interested in experimenting with the Plan 9 GUI, I would recommend 9front. However if you intend on understanding Plan 9 as an operating systems research project in the way that it was intended then start with the official distribution, set up the prerequisite file, CPU and auth servers and go from there.</description>
